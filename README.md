## Explanations of specific Technologies

## Approach Taken

I started by trying to break the project into smaller pieces.

- Make a 52 card deck
- Shuffle the deck
- Split the deck into 26 cards.
- Flip cards
- Highest card wins
- Add cards to winners deck (random positions)
- When tie pull 4 cards from deck flip top card winner takes all cards
- Add cards to winners deck (random positions)
- play until one player runs out of cards

## Unsolved Problems

Add "I declare war button for each tie"
